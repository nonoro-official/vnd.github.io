Visual Novel Development Club Website

This is a website about a video game that was developed in a school club I joined in 11th grade!
The website was made for an assignment in my web design and scripting class.

The video game is a visual novel dating simulator about supernatural characters in a magic school.

This site contains the following:
- About the club
- Characters
- Character Information 

This website was made by me, Noah! @nonoro96
Hope you enjoy checking the website!

NOTES:
Some content for the character information pages are not complete.
Unfortunately, the club was not able to finish all the information for the characters.
The club soon dissolved after the end of the school year.
This website is also currently only suited for PCs/laptops. The dimensions are not right on mobile.
