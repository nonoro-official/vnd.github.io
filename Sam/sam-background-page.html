        <p class="regular-text">Sam resembles a python of some sort with two heads, one head with functional eyes and the other with a longer neck and only a functional mouth.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="regular-text">
          At a young age, Sam was already thrown around place to place in foster care, all they had were themselves and their sister against the world. All that foster care and abuse of foster money and now they live on their own. They work as a hair stylist and even play at bars and restaurants on some occasions.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="regular-text">Now, theyâ€™re a student living a bit far from school, a good mood for them starts with a ride around the beach.</p>
