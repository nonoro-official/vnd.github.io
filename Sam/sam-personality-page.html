        <h1 class="head-text">Introverted</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">Sam is timid and shy in person and prefers to keep to themself, but they can be compared to that of roaring thunder strikes on stage! They’re cool and more social with people they’re closer to but can’t ever seem to carry out a conversation as well as many social people can.</p>

        <p class="regular-text">Sam is timid and shy in person and prefers to keep to themself, but they can be compared to that of roaring thunder strikes on stage! They’re cool and more social with people they’re closer to but can’t ever seem to carry out a conversation as well as many social people can.</p>

        <h1 class="head-text">Creative</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">Sam plays bass or lead guitar in the band, they can also sing but have the tendency to stress their ‘S’ consonants. They may be timid, but their sister snake half is separate and can help them conquer situations, which may come in handy for exams. Sam themself is pretty creative or leans more towards creative artistry in many aspects but struggles academically, which is where their sister comes in who, despite lacking vision, is academically smart.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Silent Treatment</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">Sam on rare occasions fights their conjoined half and becomes troubled, their fight’s silent treatment would last days which can affect most things they do together that require complete synchronous unity.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Feminine</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">Sam may be massive and intimidating for an average young woman, but they like feminine aesthetics and act a little more feminine than grouchy and rough, but this can backfire because on most dates they go to it never ends up working out for them.</p>
