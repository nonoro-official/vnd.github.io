        <h1 class="head-text">Eating Habits</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">Despite being a predator, they can eat anything humans can and more. They love to eat meat, as much as it’s tempting to have raw meat they must avoid doing so because it can be triggering to their senses and cause fluctuation making them deadly but manageable.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Pets (Whether Existing or Potential)</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">If they were to have a pet it would be a bird, even though it’s considered prey to Sam, they still admire birds for their ability to soar, but they cannot allow themselves to own one to avoid the risk of harming it.</p>

        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Expressing Romance</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">Sam is known for their bad dating life, they would either panic and show nervousness around the love interest or take a more slow and steady approach and learn from past mistakes, like trying to be less intimidating and more feminine despite their large and bulky appearance.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Meeting Up With Someone</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">They know their strength despite their timidness, they’ll go anyways. Curiosity kills the host of the invitation is what they believe in.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Unfortunate Events Involving Murder...</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">Sam is a good hearted individual, but they would cover it up while panicking and breaking down and probably be in an unstable state for the rest of their lives, lying on the floor rocking back and forth for hours and hours until they eventually turn themselves in because prison and justice feels better to them than guilt.</p>
