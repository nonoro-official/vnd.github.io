        <h1 class="head-text">Prepping for School</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">The Void doesn’t really sleep anyways, so it's very likely they were already busy doing something, or just lying in bed acting like they were asleep even though it isn’t possible for them.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Eating Habits</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">They like to partake in activities that make them seem more normal, so yes they would eat! Void tends to eat anything but likes things that are soft but not liquid. Crunchy stuff is okay?? Soups are mid, sweets are okay too but more puddings and moist cakes. Where does it go after??? Good question! But still, they don't need to eat to sustain themselves, they just enjoy it.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Pets (Whether Existing or Potential)</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">No pet, but tends to observe everyone else with a mild fondness/amusement that you would do when watching your pet do a silly thing-</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Allergies</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">None.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Expressing Romance</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">More on acts of service and quality time, they like doing things for the other character and just being around them, even if they don’t talk or do anything. They might,, baby their love interest a bit?</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Meeting Up With Someone</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">Woah… this is super unexpected for Void! They will definitely go and in fact even be a little excited about it, even if they don’t know the other person. 50/50 on if they would be rejected or not though.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Unfortunate Events Involving Murder...</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">The concept of a taking a life doesn’t really make sense to Void, murder doesn’t really feel like a bad thing either. It’s just another thing that’s part of the universe—the other person also likely provoked the Void, who’s usually quite careful with the more fragile beings around them, so they would feel less bad about it. On that note, they wouldn’t really cover it up nor would they run away or confess because they aren’t guilty about it at all.</p>
