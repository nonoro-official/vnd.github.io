        <h1 class="head-text">Prepping for School</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">He snoozes the alarm and goes back to sleep; he’s always late to school.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Eating Habits</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">Blood bags and organs of lambs or pigs (e.g. heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, etc.) in a cute lunch box. He watches bento making videos for funs and he does them as well.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Pets (Whether Existing or Potential)</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">A Bombay or Toyger cat– or just any cat they would pick up from the street.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Allergies</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">Ash, garlic, salt, vinegar, raw rice, or any other spices. They also don’t like the smell of burning rubber.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Expressing Romance</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">Quality time. When he does fall in love or have a crush on someone, he would invite them to eat lunch with him, listen to him play in his clubroom, or break school rules. He doesn’t talk a lot during these sessions, but he enjoys their presence in silence.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Meeting Up With Someone</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">He would still go to the meeting spot, but he peeks around the corner first to get a glimpse of the suitor’s face. If it’s someone he doesn’t recognize, he leaves immediately. If it’s an acquaintance, he listens to what they have to say; if they start the lines of a love confession, he turns them down and then leaves.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h1 class="head-text">Unfortunate Events Involving Murder...</h1>
        <p class="regular-text">They would murder someone if the murder victim wronged them in some way or just they flat out hate the victim. They cover it up if it’s someone they hate; they would hide the body! In! A! Really! Silly! Way! They would confess if it was an accidental murder, after a few days though– he would have some time on thinking.</p>
