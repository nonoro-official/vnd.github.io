        <p class="regular-text">Her mother (Retired Queen bee) is a former leader of a gang. She then inherited her mother’s throne.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="regular-text">Her mother married a clown, but she often idolizes her mom. She unknowingly inherited her father’s humor, and it often emerges when she is with close friends/crush but would frequently hide her father’s humor with everyone (because she has a laugh that’s out of her character).</p>
        <br>
        <p class="regular-text">She doesn’t like horror movies but scares the heck out of you when she crawls. She's bad at videogames. Owns a huge collection of stuffed toys but burns flowers.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="regular-text">She unironically smokes and is great at hand combat/boxing/martial arts. She approaches animals but isn’t reciprocated.</p>
